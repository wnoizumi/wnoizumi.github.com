# Removal of design problems through refactorings: are we looking at the right symptoms?
Authors: Andr√© Eposhi, Willian Oizumi, Alessandro Garcia, Leonardo Sousa, Anderson Oliveira, Roberto Oliveira

## Abstract

A design problem is the result of design decisions that negatively impact quality attributes. For example, when a stakeholder decides to addresses multiple unrelated responsibilities in a single class, impacting the modifiability and reusability of the system. Given their negative consequences, they should be identified and refactored. Despite the investigation of several studies, there is still a lack of evidence on which symptoms can be used as strong indicators of design problems. For example, it is unknown if the density and diversity of symptoms are correlated with the occurrence of design problems. Thus, in this paper, we report a case study involving two C# systems. We evaluated the impact of refactoring on the density and diversity of symptoms. Results indicate that refactored classes usually present higher density and diversity of symptoms. On the other hand, refactorings caused almost no positive impact on the density and diversity of symptoms. In fact, the most often modified classes in the systems presented a growing number of symptoms even after multiple refactorings.
